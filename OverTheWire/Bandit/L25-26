I couldn't get this one myself
grep "bandit26" /etc/passwd
cat /usr/bin/showtext
now we see that the person's shell automatically goes into more, and then exits.
So we gotta explot something about that.
well damn them, the key is to make the terminal window really small so more stays open.
ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost
v
:e /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26

After you get the password, you can do something like
:set shell=/bin/bash
:!bash
then you'll have a shell
